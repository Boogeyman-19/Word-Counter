Project: Word Counter (Build a program thatcounts the number of words in a given text)

A word counter in Python is a program or function designed to count the occurrences of each word in a given text input. This tool is particularly useful for various text processing tasks, such as analyzing documents, generating statistics, or preprocessing text data for natural language processing applications.

Project Overview:
   The Word Counter project is designed to strengthen your understanding and application of Python
programming concepts. The task involves creating a simple program that counts the number of
words in a given sentence or paragraph.

Project Objectives:-

Understanding Input Handling:  Learn how to take user input in Python.

String Manipulation:  Explore string manipulation techniques for text processing.

Function Creation:  Practice creating functions in Python for modular code.

Basic Control Flow:  Implement basic control flow structures to control the program's logic.

Output Display:  Display the word count as the output of the program.
